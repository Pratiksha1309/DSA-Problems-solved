Tiling Problem
Given a “2 x n” board and tiles of size “2 x 1”, count the number of ways to tile the given board using the 2 x 1 tiles. A tile can either be placed horizontally i.e., as a 1 x 2 tile or vertically i.e., as 2 x 1 tile. 

Examples: 

Input: n = 4
Output: 5
Explanation:
For a 2 x 4 board, there are 5 ways

All 4 vertical (1 way)
All 4 horizontal (1 way)
2 vertical and 2 horizontal (3 ways)

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation:
We need 3 tiles to tile the board of size  2 x 3.
We can tile the board using following ways


Place all 3 tiles vertically.
Place 1 tile vertically and remaining 2 tiles horizontally (2 ways)

In this problem, First tile is placed vertically, then n-1 ways will be there to place other tiles 
If placed verically 
tilingProblem(n-1)
If First tile is placed horizontally, then other is to be placed horizontally compulsary. then n-2 ways will be there.
If placed horizontally 
tilingProblem(n-2)
For calculating total ways = tilingProblem(n-1) + tilingProblem(n-2)

Suppose n = 4
If First tile is placed vertically, then 3 ways will be there to place other tiles 
If First tile is placed horizontally, then other is to be placed horizontally compulsary. then 2 ways will be there.
xn = tilingProblem(3) + tilingProblem(2)

For first vertically placed tile,
If second is placed vertically, then 2 ways will be there
If second is placed horizontally, then 1 way will be there
xn = tilingProblem(2) + tilingProblem(1) + tilingProblem(2)

For first horizontally placed tile,
If second is placed vertically, then 1 way will be there 
If second is placed is horizontally, compulsarily last tile is to be placed below it. So, 0 way will be there. But it is also 1 way.
xn = tilingProblem(1) + tilingProblem(0) + 1 + tilingProblem(1) + tilingProblem(0)
xn = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

If 1 or 0 way will be there to place tile, then return 1
